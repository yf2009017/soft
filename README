Note:
when execute config.sh for environment initilization, 
please use "source config.sh" instead of "./config.sh"

git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yf2009017/soft.git
git push -u origin master

If you want to continue making changes and pushing them to GitHub youâ€™ll just need to use the following three commands:
git add .
git commit -m "type your commit message here"
git push origin master
